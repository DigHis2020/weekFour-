Notes 

I actually enjoyed learning about Excel. 

I was confused about what kind of file I need to save my Excel work under so I chose .cvs because that was the only file that would upload successfully. 

The RStudio issue 

I recall several weeks ago, I successfully installed Anaconda Navigator on my computer. 
I have never used RStudio before but I used this link to guide myself through it. 

https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/navigator/tutorials/create-r-environment/

I followed the instructons carefully, and I created an r environment.
It loaded fully, and then a popup appeared that read: 

To use the java command line you need to install a JDK (java developer's toolkit)

I double checked that everything I was supposed to have was downloaded at this point. Confirmed. 
I have a fairly outdated Mac so I wonder if there is some major step in the process that I failed to account for.

I tried following the code in the Mac terminal but it also did not work, although I mostly expected this. 

Voyant issues 

Followed instructions perfectly. 

Clicked reveal on the Voyant site after inputting correct numbers. 

"Error: failed attempt to create a corpus."

Checked my work with this tutorial

https://voyant-tools.org/docs/#!/guide/tutorial-section-basics-of-voyant

Instead, I followed along with the example that you provided in the course.
