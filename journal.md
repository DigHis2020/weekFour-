Journal for week four 

The authors make differing arguments on how digital history is used to progress this discipline.
In the white paper reading, the workshop argues that digital history is present in historiography but lacks the respect that analog studies recieve in the academic realm. For example, digital histories rarely make the crossover into analog histories as a viable source. It seems that traditional academia has failed to maintain the strides that historical studies has made. 
The article on confabulation in digital history argues that digital history can offer a new understanding of events by using technologies to place data under a macroscope and investigate subjects from an alternate scope. 
The article on "big data for dead people" goes into depth on how digital history uses data to extrapolate information to create macroscopic and microscopic profiles of their identities. In this, Hitchcock select Sarah Durrant as a centrepoint, and use various historical data to research her until they emerge with a comprehensive profile of what it was like to be her and live her lifestyle. 
A particular weakness in digital history is that a historian's willingness to use any and all sorts of sources is contrary to the singular input that many digital history technologies require. 
"This reliance also limits the explanatory power of those methods" (Digital History and Argument). 
As a history student with the usual background in analog history, I am used to analyzing a subject in a single scope, being unable to process massive amounts of data and make observations from this intangible information. Digital history gives me the opportunity to analyze a particular scenario from many perspectives and scopes based on various data. 
The benefit of using digital history is that it can be made accessible to most readers by using laymen terminology and selecting reader-friendly visuals and explanations to detail your work.
